# palindrome
The program that will be the largest number of palindrome, which is the product of two simple five-digit numbers, as well as the factors themselves obtained. Optimize the solution method, the number of iterations to find the right solution, the quality of the code execution, and the time taken to complete this task.

We approach the solution of this problem nontrivially. We know that we have 2 prime numbers whose product should give a palindrome. The maximum 5-digit number is 99999, respectively, our answer / palindrome should not exceed the mark in 99999 * 99999 = 9 999 800 001. In this number we have 10 characters.
What do we know about palindromes, namely, how many? As we see, within 10 ^ 9 - 10 ^ 10 there are no palindromes that would be obtained by multiplying 2 any prime numbers (this can also be proved by the frequency of the appearance of a prime number and the probability of encountering a palindrome).
